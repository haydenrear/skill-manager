# Skill feedback — spec-double-compiler / tla-spec-dev

`references/migration.md` Phase 6: a migration is not done when the models
converge. It is done when everything the skill **could not express** has been
turned into a concrete recommendation against the skill repository. The skill
improves only through what real migrations fail to express.

This file is **append-only by convention**. Close-out creates it once and
thereafter only appends. Never rewrite or delete an existing finding — a filled
finding is evidence.

## How to use this file

1. At each close-out the CLI appends a `## Close-out …` entry below.
2. Fill in that entry's `feedback_status`, then record one `### SF-NNN` finding
   per thing the skill could not express.
3. **Turn every finding into a ticket or PR against the spec-double-compiler
   repository** — that is the point of this file, not the record-keeping:

   ```
   gh issue create --repo haydenrear/tla-spec-dev \
     --title "<SF-NNN one-line title>" --body-file <extract of the finding>
   ```

   Then set `recommendation:` to the resulting URL and `status: filed`.
4. If you looked and there was genuinely nothing, set
   `feedback_status: none-found`. **Silence is not an answer** — an unreviewed
   entry is recorded as unresolved in the close history.

## The four prompt categories

- `surviving-mutants` — Surviving mutants
- `unmodelable-effects` — Unmodelable effects
- `budget-and-metric` — Budget adjustments and metric calibration
- `profile-schema-cli` — Profile, schema, and CLI workarounds

## Finding format

Every finding is a `### SF-NNN` heading followed by `- key: value` lines. The
close path parses these, so keep the shape.

Fields required on every finding:

- `category:` one of `surviving-mutants`, `unmodelable-effects`, `budget-and-metric`, `profile-schema-cli`
- `target:` the exact tool surface that proved inadequate — command, script
  path and function, budget key, profile rule, or manifest field. Not "the CLI".
- `observed_on:` the real repository/module/ticket it was run against. A finding
  without a real target is a wish, not evidence.
- `evidence:` a durable path (command output, TLC log, report) — not prose.
- `severity:` one of `blocks-migration`, `silent-data-loss`, `wrong-result`, `manual-workaround`, `friction`
- `root_cause:` one of `tool`, `spec`, `target`, `unknown` — whether the
  tool's code, its specification, or the target under migration was at fault.
  A correct implementation of a wrong spec is `spec`; filing it against the
  code files it in the wrong place.
- `workaround_applied:` what the migration had to do to proceed, or `none`.
- `recommendation:` `ticket <url>` or `PR <url>` against spec-double-compiler / tla-spec-dev
- `status:` `open`, `filed`, or `wontfix`

Category-specific fields, so the common cases are structured rather than prose:

- `surviving-mutants` — `mutant:`, `operator:`, `location:`, `why_unreached:`
  (which generator, strategy, or profile rule could not reach it)
- `unmodelable-effects` — `effect:`, `why_not_port_state:`, `modeled_as:`
  (or `unmodeled`)
- `budget-and-metric` — `budget_key:`, `default_value:`, `value_used:`,
  `gated_quantity:` vs `measured_quantity:` (name both when a gate compares
  quantities that are not commensurable), `metric_blind_spot:` (what a passing
  metric failed to notice)
- `profile-schema-cli` — `surface:`, `forced_workaround:`, `data_loss:`
  (`yes`/`no`)

## Worked examples

These are real findings this epic produced *before* this template existed. They
are the calibration for what a good finding looks like; they are recorded here
as `SF-000x` examples and are excluded from filing status.

### SF-000a — Projected complexity reduction required deleting real behavior
- category: budget-and-metric
- target: scripts/analyze_complexity.py — projected-reduction reporting
- observed_on: tla-spec-dev @ MF-020 (ticket_phase ordinal collapse)
- evidence: specs/.history/modular-fuzzing-epic/ticket-*-MF-020/
- severity: wrong-result
- root_cause: tool
- gated_quantity: distinct reachable states
- measured_quantity: generated states
- metric_blind_spot: deleted self-loops. Reproducing the projected -13.1%
  required tightening a guard from `>= 2` to `= 2`, deleting a legitimate
  idempotent re-fire transition. The distinct-state gate is structurally blind
  to that, so a behavior deletion scored as a re-representation win.
- workaround_applied: projection withdrawn by hand after transition-level diff
- recommendation: ticket (example only)
- status: wontfix

### SF-000b — Promotion destroyed files unique to specs/current
- category: profile-schema-cli
- target: scripts/spec_evolution.py::replace_tree (ticket-close promotion)
- observed_on: tla-spec-dev @ MF-012, MF-020, MF-021
- evidence: tests/test_promotion_preserves_current.py
- severity: silent-data-loss
- root_cause: tool
- surface: `tla-spec-dev close ticket` promotion step
- forced_workaround: restore deleted regression tests from git history
- data_loss: yes
- recommendation: ticket https://github.com/haydenrear/tla-spec-dev/issues/22
- status: filed

### SF-000c — PATH wrapper ran pre-epic code for an entire epic
- category: profile-schema-cli
- target: `tla-spec-dev` PATH wrapper -> ~/.skill-manager/skills/spec-double-compiler
- observed_on: tla-spec-dev @ modular-fuzzing epic (all tickets)
- evidence: specs/desired_program_model/ticket_plan.yaml (toolchain_rule)
- severity: wrong-result
- root_cause: tool
- surface: skill installation / PATH shim
- forced_workaround: pin every lifecycle command to
  `python3 scripts/tla_spec_dev.py --spec-root specs ...`
- data_loss: yes — the stale wrapper is why the promotion defect fired three
  times, including once after its fix had merged
- recommendation: ticket (example only)
- status: wontfix

### SF-000d — Bound gate compared incommensurable quantities
- category: budget-and-metric
- target: scripts/analyze_complexity.py — state-space bound gate
- observed_on: tla-spec-dev @ MF-011
- evidence: specs/.history/modular-fuzzing-epic/ticket-*-MF-011/
- severity: blocks-migration
- root_cause: spec
- budget_key: max_distinct_states
- default_value: 50000
- value_used: new `max_state_space_bound` added (MF-022)
- gated_quantity: static state-space upper bound (1,179,648)
- measured_quantity: actual reachable distinct states (2,923)
- metric_blind_spot: a ~400x over-approximation failed a model 17x *under* its
  own budget; the tool's own recommended optimum still failed the gate.
- workaround_applied: none — gate reported its own failure rather than tuning
- recommendation: ticket https://github.com/haydenrear/tla-spec-dev/issues/28
- status: filed
